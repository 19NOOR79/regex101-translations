# Translations for regex101

Base your translation off of `english.json`. The keys are the english words, do not touch these. They need to remain identical. If there is a typo or problem, open an issue/inform me and I'll sort it out. Strings may contain placeholders, indicated with `{n}` where `n` is a positive number greater than zero. Do not remove these, but feel free to move them around. Quite often you can figure out what they are inserting (almost always a non-translatable string, such as a number).

When you are finished, just push your changes over here in a new json file with the language name.

**Note: The strings are treated literally, you may not (and need not) use any html tags or entities.** 

## Example

```json
{ 
  "Match found in {1} step(s)": "Match funnen efter {1} steg",
}
```
